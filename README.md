We going to do a simple react ssr app with routing

--Before, check [here =>](https://github.com/mpeix/react-ssr) my explanation how to create a SSR React Landing page

### 1.  Install React Router

```
npm install react-router-dom 
```
### 2. Create your pages
Create componets that you will be use as pages, for example the Home, About us, ...
Don't forget to creat a 404 page.
I usually group my pages inside a views folder.

### 3.  Create config file
Probably the best way to don't get crazy with routes is gruop all in a single file.

### 3.  Add browserroutes 
### 4.  Add routes and links
### 5.  Add static router
